## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:

### Data Loading: 
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

### Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values.

Filled missing values in the 'duration', 'rating', and 'date_added' columns with their respective modes.

Converted the 'date_added' column to datetime objects.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the distribution of content types (Movie vs. TV Show) using value counts and a pie chart.

Examined the distribution of ratings using value counts and a bar plot.

Identified and listed the top 10 directors based on the number of movies/TV shows they have directed in the dataset.
